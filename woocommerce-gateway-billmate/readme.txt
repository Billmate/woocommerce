##Description
Billmate Gateway is a plugin that extends WooCommerce, allowing your customers to get their products first and pay by invoice to Billmate later (https://www.billmate.se/). This plugin utilizes Billmate Invoice, Billmate Card, Billmate Bank and Billmate Part Payment (Standard Integration type).

When the order is passed to Billmate a credit record of the customer is made. If the check turns out all right, Billmate creates an invoice in their system. After you (as the merchant) completes the order in Prestashop, you need to log in to Billmate to approve/send the invoice.

Billmate is a great payment alternative for merchants and customers in Sweden.


##Important note
The invoice and part payment plugin only works if the currency is set to Swedish Krona (SEK) and the Base country is set to Sweden.
