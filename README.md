##Description
Billmate Gateway is a plugin that extends WooCommerce, allowing your customers to get their products first and pay by invoice to Billmate later (https://www.billmate.se/). This plugin utilizes Billmate Invoice, Billmate Card, Billmate Bank and Billmate Part Payment (Standard Integration type).

When the order is passed to Billmate a credit record of the customer is made. If the check turns out all right, Billmate creates an invoice in their system. After you (as the merchant) completes the order in Prestashop, you need to log in to Billmate to approve/send the invoice.

Billmate is a great payment alternative for merchants and customers in Sweden.


##Important note
The invoice and part payment plugin only works if the currency is set to Swedish Krona (SEK) and the Base country is set to Sweden.

##PClasses and Billmate Part Payment
To enable Billmate Part Payment you need to store your available billmatepclasses in the file billmatepclasses.json located in woocommerce-gateway-billmate/srv/. Make sure that read and write permissions for the directory "srv" is set to 777 in order to fetch the available PClasses from Billmate. To retrieve your PClasses from Billmate go to --> WooCommerce --> Settings --> Payment Gateways --> Billmate Part Payment and click the button "Update the PClass file billmatepclasses.json".
If you want to, you can also manually upload your billmatepclasses.json file via ftp.
